# 🚇 Pipeline Transport Simulation (Gazebo)

A simulation-based project that demonstrates the concept of transporting vehicles through a **pipeline infrastructure** using robotic mobility logic inside Gazebo.

This project visualizes how cars can move from one location to another through a predefined pipe network — inspired by futuristic transport systems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This simulation focuses on designing a **pipeline-based transportation system** where:

- Vehicles move through closed pipe pathways  
- Movement is guided through predefined routes  
- Transfer happens between different nodes/stations  

The system is developed and tested inside a virtual environment using Gazebo.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To simulate a transport mechanism where:

- Vehicles travel inside pipeline structures  
- Controlled movement occurs between source and destination  
- Pathways guide navigation inside a structured network

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- ROS 2  
- Gazebo Simulation  
- URDF/Xacro (for modeling)
- Robot motion control  
- Path-based movement logic  

---

## 🧩 System Design

The simulation includes:

- Pipeline network layout  
- Entry & exit points  
- Mobile vehicle units  
- Controlled transfer paths  

Vehicles move through the pipe structure from one station to another based on defined navigation logic.
